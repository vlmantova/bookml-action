# Compile with BookML
GitHub action for compiling LaTeX files to HTML using [BookML](https://vlmantova.github.io/bookml/).

## Basic usage
Add the file `.github/workflows/bookml.yaml` to your GitHub repository with the following content:
```YAML
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Compile with BookML
        uses: vlmantova/bookml-action@v1
```
On every push, the action will checkout the repository, compile all .tex files containing the string `\documentclass`, then create a GitHub release containing all the outputs generated by BookML. The `permissions` key is necessary to create GitHub releases.

## Options

<dl>
<dt>checkout</dt><dd>Whether to checkout the repository. Default: <code>true</code> (boolean).</dd>
<dt>release</dt><dd>Whether to create a release containing the outputs generated by BookML. Default: <code>true</code> (boolean).</dd>
<dt>version</dt><dd>Select which version of BookML to use. Note that this only affects which Docker image is used; if the <code>bookml/</code> folder is already present in the repository, that version of BookML will be used. Default: <code>'latest'</code> (string).</dd>
<dt>replace-bookml</dt><dd>Whether to replace the <code>bookml/</code> folder with the one provided by the Docker image. Default: <code>false</code> (boolean).</dd>
<dt>scheme</dt><dd>Select which TeX Live scheme to use among basic, small, medium, full. Default: <code>'full'</code> (string).</dd>
<dt>timeout-minutes</dt><dd>The maximum number of minutes to run BookML before cancelling the build. Default: <code>6</code> (positive integer).</dd>
</dl>

For example, the following will use the BookML v0.12.0 Docker image, replace the `bookml/` folder with v0.12.0, use the TeX Live scheme small, and set a longer timeout.
```YAML
- name: Compile with BookML
  uses: vlmantova/bookml-action@v1
  with:
    scheme: small
    version: v0.12.0
    replace-bookml: true
    timeout-minutes: 15
```
